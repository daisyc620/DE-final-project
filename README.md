# DE-final-project

"This project represents a sophisticated data engineering endeavor focused on currency exchange rate analysis. Initially, we employ an API to fetch real-time data, updating our database with ten critical currency pairs. Subsequently, we leverage this data to train a predictive model, aimed at forecasting currency trends. This model informs our strategic decisions to either long or short specific assets. Finally, we rigorously test the model's predictions against actual market outcomes using metrics such as the Sharpe ratio to evaluate performance and accuracy."
